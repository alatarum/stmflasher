 Installation Instructions
 *************************

 Install from sources
 ====================

 This project uses cmake build system to generate Makefiles and/or IDE project
 files so you need to have cmake installed to build stmflasher. There are no
 other dependencies except compiler distribution and cmake system. Currently
 program is tested on the following platforms:
 * Gentoo Linux amd64/13.0/developer + gcc 4.6.3
 * FreeBSD 9.0 amd64 + gcc 4.2.1
 * Windows 7 i386 + MinGW gcc 4.7.0

 On *NIX or MS Windows with MinGW
 ================================

 To build the program, follow these steps:
 1. `cd' to the `build' subdirectory of stmflasher source tree.
 2. Type `cmake ..' to generate Makefiles for your system. If you want to
    create an additional project file for some IDE, you can use -G option. See
    cmake documentation for more info.
 3. Type `make' to compile the package.
 4. You can type `make install' to install the program to the system, but you
    must keep in mind that cmake-generated Makefiles do not have `uninstall'
    target! Besides, it is not recommended to install programs manually in
    modern operating systems. You can try to use checkinstall on Debian-based
    systems. On another distributions you should create package if you want to
    install the program system-wide.

 Install distribution
 ====================

 Currently only binary for MS Windows is available to download from project's
 site. There is only one non-GUI executable file, so there is no installer -
 you can simply copy it wherever you want.
 If you use Gentoo Linux, you can download live ebuild from the site to install
 latest SVN version of the program with portage.
